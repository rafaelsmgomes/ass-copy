  Home page:
    ✔ The “more info” button - i really don’t like how when you click it, the entire background and white box move. Can we just have the white box increases in height, so it doesn’t feel like a weird jump? plus animation (the old text box fades out, the new text fades in, and the white box slides open more—instead of a stark pop)?
    ✔ (transition to Question 1): i thought we had discussed having an animation here, sliding left to right into Question 1. I think it will help this feel better, it feels dead. Can we implement that please?
  Gate page:
    ✔ can you please make the spacing below the “Names” and “business email / job title” boxes the same as the spacing between the dropdown boxes? right now it’s larger and looks off.
    ☐ the last dropdown (“Who owns your supply chain sustainability program?“), you should only be able to select ONE checkbox. it’s not a “select all that apply”
    ☐ Results page: the left side still shows “X” icons, not the lightbulb icons. But Annie caught that too.
  Report page:
    ☐ “Book a demo” button in the page body should be the same as the header (bring up the same form/pop-up)
