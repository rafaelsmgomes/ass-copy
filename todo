Form data:
  Problem? 
  1) ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ Pardot does not accept axios submissions with data
  2) ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥ For some fields, I need to submit the data as string - no array of data will be accepted. 
    Therefore, I need to be able to either
        1- manipulate data on submit to concatenate 
        2- concatenate the data before I submit it
  3) Have to be able to test the form capture after I send it to see if the data is correct
    Get the script to add the UTM params to the text inputs

Questions:
  1) 
  2)
